**Answer: Minor (1)**

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
#### 6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization?
**Answer: Undefined (1)**

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
#### 7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML, specifically focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML?
**Answer: Could not be evaluated (0)**

These ratings are based on the overall insufficient reference to specific "computing systems" topics in the provided syllabus. The included documents did not show significant detail or frequent mentions of specialized hardware, software, programming models, compilers, and runtimes for scalable AI/ML systems. The course majorly focuses on general AI/ML algorithms and concepts as indicated in the syllabus【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:6†source】.
