1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course?
Answer: Infrequent (2)

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:

2.1 How are the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula?
Answer: Inadequate (2)

2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?
Topics discussed: 3: ML programming models and abstractions; 4: programming languages for machine learning (minimal coverage); 7: hardware-efficient ML methods (indirectly in the context of optimization algorithms).

3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?
Answer: No guidelines (1)

3.2 How did the discussion of “computing system” requirements rank against the discussion of general AI/ML topics?
Answer: “computing system” requirements is a sub topic (2)

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:

4.1 How is the importance of various “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course?
Answer: System (1)

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:

5.1 Are real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving explicitly included in the curriculum?
Answer: Minor (1)

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:

6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization?
Answer: Inadequate (2)

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:

7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML, specifically focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML?
Answer: Could not be evaluated (0)

The primary focus of the syllabus is on general AI/ML algorithms, theoretical foundations, and applications rather than on detailed aspects of computing systems tailored for AI/ML scalability .
