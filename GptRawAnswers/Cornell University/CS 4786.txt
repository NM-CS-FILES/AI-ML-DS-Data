### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency
**Score: 1 (Never mentioned)**
From the syllabus, topics related to "computing systems" specialized for ML/AI, such as scalable training, ML programming models, ML compilers, specialized hardware, or efficient ML methods, were not explicitly discussed.

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding
#### 2.1
**Score: 1 (Undefined)**
The course does not provide detailed definitions or explanations on the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML, including aspects like scalable training, ML compilers, or specialized hardware.
#### 2.2
The course briefly discusses general machine learning topics but does not cover specific "computing systems" concepts. 
- Scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference
- Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
- ML programming models and abstractions
- Programming languages for machine learning
- ML compilers and runtimes
- Specialized hardware for machine learning
- Hardware-efficient ML methods
- Machine learning benchmarks, and tooling

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification
#### 3.1 
**Score: 1 (No guidelines)**
The syllabus does not mention computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems in depth.

#### 3.2
**Score: 1 (Never discussed)**
“Computing system” requirements were never explicitly discussed.

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance
#### 4.1
**Score: 1 (System)**
The syllabus suggests that the course relegates the responsibility of computing system aspects to other areas like hardware choice or framework, not accounting for multiple computing system factors.

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
#### 5.1
**Score: 1 (Minor)**
The syllabus does not indicate that computational performance and capability of underlying systems are major concerns of case studies.

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices
#### 6.1
**Score: 1 (Undefined)**
Discussions on AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically regarding compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization, are either unclear or not present.

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation
#### 7.1
**Score: 0 (Could not be evaluated)**
Insufficient information or exposure to the assignments in the syllabus to provide an evaluation on hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML.
