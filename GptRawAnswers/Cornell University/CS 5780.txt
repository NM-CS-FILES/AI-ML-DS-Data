### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
**Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - Never mentioned.

The syllabus for CS 5780 predominantly focuses on supervised learning, theoretical foundations, and algorithms related to general machine learning and AI concepts【4:0†source】 . There is no specific mention of topics related to computing systems tailored for ML/AI scalability such as model training, inference, testing, debugging, monitoring of ML applications, and specialized hardware.

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
**2.1 Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - Undefined.

The syllabus does not provide detailed definitions or explanations of the impact of computing systems on AI/ML, focusing more on general machine learning algorithms and theories【4:0†source】 .

**2.2 List of Discussed Topics Related to "Computing Systems":**
- None of the mentioned topics (scalable model training/inference, debugging/monitoring, ML programming models, programming languages, ML compilers/runtimes, specialized hardware for ML, hardware-efficient ML methods, benchmarks, and tooling) are explicitly covered in the syllabus.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
**3.1 Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - No guidelines.

The syllabus does not provide computational performance and capability requirements of hardware and software systems for AI/ML. The focus remains on machine learning algorithms, projects, homework, and exams without specifying computational guidelines【4:0†source】 .

**3.2 Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - "computing system" requirements were never discussed.

From the course outline and schedule, it is clear that the requirement specifications for computing systems are not discussed at all compared to general AI/ML topics【4:0†source】 .

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
**Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - System.

The importance of various computing system factors in designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML seems to be viewed as low-level issues, with minimal emphasis placed on making correct choices of hardware, programming models, and AI/ML frameworks【4:0†source】 .

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
**Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - Minor.

The course syllabus does not list any real-world case studies particularly focusing on computational performance and capability of the underlying system for scalable AI/ML model training, inference, and serving【4:0†source】 .

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
**Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - Undefined.

The courses do not appear to cover contributions or best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities adequately, specifically in areas of compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization【4:0†source】 .

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
**Overall Likert Scale Rating**: 1 - None.

There is no evidence in the syllabus indicating that assignments provide hands-on experience with designing or optimizing scalable hardware and software systems specifically for AI/ML compiler optimization, runtime systems, or hardware acceleration【4:0†source】 .
