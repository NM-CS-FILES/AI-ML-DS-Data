### Research Questions (RQ) Evaluation

Based on the provided information in the syllabus for CS 6780 - Advanced Machine Learning, here are the evaluations:

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency
1.1 **Overall Frequency of Computing System Topics Specialized for ML/AI**
- **Score**: Intermittent (3)
  - **Topics Evaluated:**
    - "Supervised Batch Learning"
    - "Deep Learning"
    - "Large Language Models"
    - "Computer Vision"

Although these topics touch on system-related aspects, they do not focus heavily on specialized hardware, ML compilers, or programming languages dedicated to hardware efficiency in ML, implying an intermittent mention .

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding
2.1 **Impacts of Computing Systems on AI/ML Defined in Undergraduate Curricula**
- **Score**: Inadequate (2)
  - Majority of the topics likely missed significant coverage in lectures or assignments, particularly those related to highly technical aspects of HPC tailored for AI/ML.

2.2 **Explicit Definition of Impacts Discussed**
- **Topics Discussed**:
  - Model Training and Inference (Supervised Batch Learning, Deep Learning)
  - Hardware Efficiency (implicitly in Deep Learning, Large Language Models with stochastic gradient methods)
   
Discussed briefly but not in comprehensive detail, focusing more on general application methodologies rather than deep dives into those specialized for efficient computing systems【6:0†source】.

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification
3.1 **Computational Performance and Capability Requirements Detailed**
- **Score**: No Guidelines (1)
  - The course material does not quantitatively specify computational performance and system requirements such as latency, throughput, or resource utilization.

3.2 **Discussion of Computing System Requirements vs. General AI/ML Topics**
- **Score**: Computing system requirements is a sub-topic (2)
  - Predominant focus on models and theoretical underpinnings of AI/ML with computing system needs usually inferred or assumed, indicating less primary emphasis on hardware requirements or parallel computing setups .

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance
4.1 **Importance of Computing System Factors Emphasized**
- **Score**: System (1)
  - Course viewed factors as low-level system issues, relegating the responsibility to the correct application of AI/ML models, without delving deeply into systemic computational architecture decisions .

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
5.1 **Real-world Case Studies Included with Focus on Computational Performance**
- **Score**: Major (2)
  - While practical projects and open research topics are discussed, the explicit focus on underlying system performance and computational capabilities is not heavily emphasized in the curriculum description .

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices
6.1 **Contributions and Best Practices from AI/ML System Engineering Communities Discussed**
- **Score**: Inadequate (2)
  - Mentions of advanced methodologies like stochastic gradient, but lacks in-depth coverage of AI-specific engineering best practices, compilers, runtimes or optimizations from current state-of-the-art perspectives .

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation
7.1 **Hands-on Experience with Scalable Hardware and Software Systems**
- **Score**: Inadequate (2)
  - Though projects are a significant component, focus appears more on theory and application rather than substantial hands-on work with hardware, compiler optimizations, and runtime systems .
