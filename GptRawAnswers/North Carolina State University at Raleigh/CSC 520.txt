Based on the detailed review of the provided syllabus, here's an evaluation of how the course content addresses specific research questions (RQ) related to computing systems tailored for AI/ML scalability:

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
**1.1** Rating: **Infrequent (2)**  
The course content rarely mentions topics related to computing systems specialized for ML/AI such as scalable model training, ML compilers, and specialized hardware【6:0†source】  .

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
**2.1** Rating: **Inadequate (2)**  
The impacts of computing systems on AI/ML are mentioned but many significant topics such as hardware-efficient ML methods and ML compilers are missing detailed discussion【6:0†source】 .

**2.2** Topics Discussed:
- Scalable (parallel and distributed) model training and inference.
- ML programming models and abstractions.
- Specialized hardware for machine learning.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
**3.1** Rating: **No guidelines (1)**  
The course does not provide explicit computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML .

**3.2** Rating: **“computing system” requirements is a sub topic (2)**  
Discussions on computing system requirements are subordinate to more general AI/ML topics .

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
**4.1** Rating: **System (1)**  
The course seems to view computing system factors as lower-level issues, considering responsibility to lie in the choice of hardware and AI/ML framework  .

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
**5.1** Rating: **Minor (1)**  
Real-world case studies focusing on computational performance and capability of underlying systems for AI/ML are not a major concern in the course. Emphasis is more on general applications .

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
**6.1** Rating: **Inadequate (2)**  
The courses mention contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities but without sufficient detail .

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
**7.1** Rating: **None (1)**  
Assignments do not provide notable hands-on experience in designing, building, and maintaining scalable hardware/software systems for AI/ML【8:0†source】. 

These evaluations reflect the overall integration of computing system-specific topics within the context of the course as represented in the provided documents.
