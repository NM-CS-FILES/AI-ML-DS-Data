### Review of the Course Syllabus for "Computing Systems" in ML/AI Scalability

Based on the provided course syllabus content, here's the detailed analysis for each research question (RQ). The content is evaluated to determine the inclusion of specific topics related to computing systems specialized for ML/AI. 

---

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency

1.1 **Frequency of Topics Related to Computing Systems Specialized for ML/AI:**

- **Score:** **Never mentioned (1)**

The syllabus does not explicitly mention detailed discussions or dedicated lectures on the computing system topics specified. The focus is more on foundational AI principles and techniques such as machine learning, search, and Markov decision processes without delving into specialized hardware, compilers, runtimes, or programming models for AI/ML.

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding

2.1 **Definition and Explanation of Impacts of Computing Systems:**

- **Score:** **Undefined (1)**

There is no evidence from the syllabus that the impacts of computing systems on AI/ML, particularly the specified topics, are defined or explained within the curriculum.

2.2 **Comprehensive and Explicit Definitions:**

- **Topics Mentioned:** None found explicitly in the syllabus.

The course content outlined in the syllabus focuses on general AI/ML principles with no specific mention of scalable model training, ML compilers, specialized hardware, or other computing system concerns.

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification

3.1 **Computational Performance and Capability Requirements:**

- **Score:** **No guidelines (1)**

The syllabus does not indicate that lectures or assignments provide numerical values or qualitative descriptions for performance and capability requirements regarding hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML.

3.2 **Ranking of "Computing System" Requirements:**

- **Score:** **“computing system” requirements were never discussed (1)**

Discussions related to computational performance and capability requirements are not apparent in the syllabus, focusing instead on general AI/ML topics.

---

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance

4.1 **Importance of Computing Systems Factors:**

- **Score:** **System (1)**

There seems to be an absence of a holistic view of various computing system factors in the design and maintenance of scalable AI/ML systems in the course, relegating the discussion to fundamental AI concepts without integrating detailed system-level discussions.

---

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications

5.1 **Inclusion of Real-World Case Studies:**

- **Score:** **Minor (1)**

The syllabus does not indicate the inclusion of real-world case studies that focus on the computational performance and capability of hardware and software systems for AI/ML scalability.

---

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices

6.1 **Discussion of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:**

- **Score:** **Undefined (1)**

Course coverage on contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, especially on specific topics like compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization, is unclear or not well-defined in the syllabus. 

---

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation

7.1 **Assignments Providing Hands-On Experience:**

- **Score:** **None (1)**

Based on the syllabus, assignments do not appear to provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining scalable hardware and software systems specific to compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML.

---

The syllabus provided offers a solid introduction to foundational AI and machine learning concepts, but it lacks detailed instruction and practical application specifically focused on advanced computing systems for AI/ML scalability. This absence is reflected in the low scores across all research questions. 

For deeper integration of the discussed topics, the course could benefit from modules specifically on ML compilers, runtime optimization, specialized hardware, and scalable training methods.
