Let's address each research question (RQ) based on the provided CSE 357 syllabus.

**RQ 1: Course Content and Frequency**

1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course? 

Based on the syllabus content, the course does not explicitly cover topics directly related to computing systems specialized for ML/AI such as scalable (parallel and distributed) model training and inference, ML compilers and runtimes, specialized hardware, and other advanced computing systems topics. Therefore, the rating would be:

**Never mentioned (1)**

**RQ 2: Definition and Understanding**

2.1 How are the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula? 

Based on the syllabus content, there is no detailed definition or explanation provided for the impacts of computing systems on AI/ML specialized topics. Therefore, the rating would be:

**Undefined (1)**

2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?

No topics from the defined list (scalable model training, debugging, ML programming models, etc.) are discussed in this course. 

**RQ 3: Requirement Specification**

3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?

There is no discussion on computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems in the syllabus. Therefore, the rating would be:

**No guidelines (1)**

3.2 How did the discussion of “computing system” requirements rank against the discussion of general AI/ML topics?

The syllabus primarily focuses on statistical methods and data science topics without discussing computing system requirements relevant to AI/ML. Therefore, the rating would be:

**“computing system” requirements were never discussed (1)**

**RQ 4: Influence and Importance**

4.1 How is the importance of various “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course?

None of the specified factors related to computing systems (e.g., scalable model training, ML compilers, specialized hardware) are emphasized in the course. Therefore, the rating would be:

**System (1)**

**RQ 5: Case Studies and Real-World Applications**

5.1 Are real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving explicitly included in the curriculum?

The syllabus does not include real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for scalable AI/ML. Therefore, the rating would be:

**Minor (1)**

**RQ 6: Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices**

6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities?

The syllabus does not mention contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities related to advanced computing system topics. Therefore, the rating would be:

**Undefined (1)**

**RQ 7: Projects and Practical Implementation**

7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML?

The assignments do not cover hands-on experience with scalable hardware and software systems specifically for AI/ML topics such as compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, and hardware acceleration. Therefore, the rating would be:

**None (1)**

Based on the syllabus content for CSE 357: Statistical Methods for Data Science, the course does not cover topics explicitly related to computing systems specialized for ML/AI. This includes scalable model training, ML compilers, specialized hardware, and other advanced computing systems topics.
