### Research Questions Analysis Based on Syllabus

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency
1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course?

Score: **1 - Never mentioned**

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding
2.1 How are the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula?

Score: **1 - Undefined**

2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?

None of the specified topics concerning computing systems specialized for AI/ML (parallel/distributed model training, debugging, ML compilers, hardware, etc.) are listed in the syllabus .

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification
3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?

Score: **1 - No guidelines**

3.2 How did the discussion of “computing system” requirements rank against the discussion of general AI/ML topics?

Score: **1 - “Computing system” requirements were never discussed**

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance
4.1 How is the importance of various “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course?

Score: **1 - System**

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
5.1 Are real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving explicitly included in the curriculum?

Score: **1 - Minor**  

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices
6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization?

Score: **1 - Undefined**  

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation
7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML, specifically focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML?

Score: **0 - Could not be evaluated** 

The syllabus provides scant information on practical assignments related to these specific computing system topics .

Note: The syllabus reviewed appears to focus broadly on AI topics, often lacking specificity toward computing systems specialized for AI/ML scalability.
