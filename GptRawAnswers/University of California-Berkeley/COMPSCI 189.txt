### Answers based on the provided syllabus:

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:

**Frequency of topics related to "computing systems" specialized for ML/AI:**
- Scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference
- Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
- ML programming models and abstractions
- Programming languages for machine learning
- ML compilers and runtimes
- Specialized hardware for machine learning
- Hardware-efficient ML methods
- Machine learning benchmarks, and tooling

**Score:**
Intermittent (3)

Despite some coverage of specific aspects like scalable model training or specialized hardware, the explicit discussion on all the listed specialized computing systems appears occasionally in the course materials.

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
**2.1 Impact of "computing systems" on AI/ML in undergraduate curricula:**

**Score:**
Inadequate (2)

The detailed definition and explanation of the impacts of computing systems on AI/ML are often missed or not comprehensively covered.

**2.2 Comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML:**

**Topics Discussed:**
- Scalable model training, inference (e.g., Gradient Descent, Neural Networks)【4:3†source】
- Specialized hardware for machine learning (possibly implied in Convolutional Neural Networks)【6:1†source】
- ML programming models and abstractions, ML compilers and runtimes, and testing, debugging, monitoring do not seem explicitly discussed.

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
**3.1 Computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems:**

**Score:**
No guidelines (1)

There is no evidence of numerical values for computational performance and capability requirements being provided in the lectures or assignments.

**3.2 Discussion of “computing system” requirements in comparison to general AI/ML topics:**

**Score:**
“Computing system” requirements is a sub topic (2)

Discussions on computing system requirements appear to be supplementary and less emphasized compared to general AI/ML topics.

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
**4.1 Importance of various “computing system” factors in designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML:**

**Score:**
Holistic (2)

Several key factors like scalable model training and possible mentions of specialized hardware imply a holistic approach.

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
**5.1 Inclusion of real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML:**

**Score:**
Minor (1)

Case studies with a major concern on computational performance and capability do not explicitly appear.

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
**6.1 Discussion of contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities:**

**Score:**
Undefined (1)

There is no clear indication of thorough coverage of AI/ML system engineering communities' contributions or best practices.

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
**7.1 Extent of hands-on experience assignments in designing scalable hardware/software systems for AI/ML:**

**Score:**
Inadequate (2)

The assignments cover related areas minimally and do not seem to provide extensive hands-on experience.

These evaluations reflect an overall intermittent discussion and inadequacy in defining and understanding the impacts and specifications of computing systems tailored for AI/ML scalability in the course.
