Based on the provided syllabus for the "CS171: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course, here are the detailed answers to your research questions (RQ):

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
**1.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (Never mentioned)

The topics specifically related to "computing systems" specialized for ML/AI, such as scalable model training and specialized hardware, are not explicitly covered in the syllabus for this course.

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
**2.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (Undefined)

The syllabus does not provide any detailed definitions or explanations of the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML in the context of this undergraduate course. 

**2.2 List of topics discussed:**
None of the specific topics mentioned (scalable model training, ML compilers and runtimes, specialized hardware, etc.) are discussed.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
**3.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (No guidelines)

There is no explicit specification or discussion about the computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML in the syllabus.

**3.2 Likert scale rating:** 1 (computing system requirements were never discussed)

"Computing system" requirements are not discussed in regard to general AI/ML topics.

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
**4.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (System)

The factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML systems are not emphasized in the course. The syllabus approaches these factors as low-level system issues.

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
**5.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (Minor)

Computational performance and capability of the underlying system is not a major concern of the case studies included in the curriculum.

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
**6.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (Undefined)

The course does not cover contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities in detail.

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
**7.1 Likert scale rating:** 1 (None)

The assignments do not cover areas like compiler optimization, runtime system optimization, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML nor do they provide hands-on experience related to these topics.
