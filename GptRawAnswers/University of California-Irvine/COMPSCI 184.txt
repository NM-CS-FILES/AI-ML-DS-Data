**Score: Minor (1)**
  
#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization?

**Score: Undefined (1)**
  
#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML, specifically focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML?

**Score: Adequate (3)**

This analysis is based on the contents of the syllabus provided, where the primary focus is on applications of AI/ML in biology and medicine, with less emphasis on computing systems specialized for AI/ML scalability【6:0†source】.
