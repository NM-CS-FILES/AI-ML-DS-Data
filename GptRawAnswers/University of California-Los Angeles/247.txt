2. **[8:0†Course Projects and Topics]**

The course syllabus primarily covers machine learning algorithms and theoretical topics. The interpretation of scalable computing systems in the context of AI/ML, particularly in the sense of hardware acceleration, compilers, and optimization, appears to be minimal or implied rather than explicitly detailed.
