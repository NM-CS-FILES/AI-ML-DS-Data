Based on the provided syllabus details for the course "CS260 - Machine Learning Algorithms" from the uploaded file , here are the detailed answers to the research questions (RQ):

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
1.1: **Infrequent (2)**
The syllabus focuses primarily on foundational concepts and algorithms in machine learning and deep learning, and does not explicitly list several topics related to ML/AI-specific computing systems.

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
2.1: **Inadequate (2)**
The syllabus does not provide detailed definitions or explanations regarding the impact of computing systems on AI/ML. Most topics such as compilers, runtimes, and specialized hardware are not significantly discussed.

2.2:
List of topics discussed:
- Empirical Risk Minimization
- PAC Learning
- Linear Regression
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks
The course syllabus does not include in-depth discussions on computing systems specialized for AI/ML like ML compilers, runtimes, specialized hardware, or benchmarking tools .

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
3.1: **No guidelines (1)**
The syllabus does not specify computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems explicitly in terms of numerical values or descriptive terms.

3.2: **“computing system” requirements were never discussed (1)**
Discussions about computing system requirements do not appear prominently in the syllabus. The primary focus is on general AI/ML topics rather than specific system requirements .

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
4.1: **System (1)**
The syllabus does not emphasize the importance of various computing system factors explicitly. The discussed topics primarily relate to machine learning algorithms rather than scalable system issues .

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
5.1: **Minor (1)**
Case studies or practical examples concerning computational performance and scalable AI/ML systems are not a major part of the curriculum as evident from the provided syllabus details.

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
6.1: **Undefined (1)**
There is no clear discussion or adequate coverage on contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities related to compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization in the syllabus .

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
7.1: **None (1)**
The assignments in the course do not cover hands-on experience with compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML .

These evaluations demonstrate that the course primarily focuses on machine learning algorithms and theoretical foundations, with limited coverage of specialized computing system topics crucial for AI/ML scalability.
