### Analysis of Course Syllabus for Computing Systems in AI/ML

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
**Score:** 
Intermittent (3): The topics are discussed occasionally.

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
**RQ 2.1 Score:** 
Inadequate (2): Many of the topics missed significant discussion in lectures or in assignments.

**RQ 2.2 Topics Discussed:**
1. Scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference
2. ML programming models and abstractions
3. Specialized hardware for machine learning
4. Machine learning benchmarks, and tooling
5. Programming languages for machine learning
6. ML compilers and runtimes
7. Hardware-efficient ML methods【8:0†source】

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
**RQ 3.1 Score:** 
No guidelines (1): The lectures provide no guidelines.

**RQ 3.2 Score:** 
“computing system” requirements is a sub topic (2)

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
**Score:**
System (1): The course viewed the factors as low level system issue, relegating responsibility to correct choice of hardware, programming model and AI/ML framework.

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
**Score:**
Minor (1): Computational performance and capability of the underlying system was not a major concern of the case studies.

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
**Score:**
Inadequate (2): The courses mention the topic but do not cover it in sufficient depth or detail.

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
**Score:**
None (1): The assignments do not cover these areas or provide relevant hands-on experience.
