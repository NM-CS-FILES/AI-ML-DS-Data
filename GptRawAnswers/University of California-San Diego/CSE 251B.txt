Based on the given syllabus and the specified research questions (RQs), the detailed answers are as follows:

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
1.1 The topics related to "computing systems" specialized for ML/AI are discussed as follows:
- Scalable model training, inference: Mentioned in the context of deep learning implementation【6:0†source】.
- Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications: Not explicitly mentioned.
- ML programming models and abstractions: General machine learning models are discussed, but not specific to programming models or abstractions【6:0†source】.
- Programming languages for ML: Not explicitly mentioned in the context of computing systems impacts.
- ML compilers and runtimes: Not explicitly mentioned.
- Specialized hardware for ML: Not explicitly mentioned.
- Hardware-efficient ML methods: Not explicitly mentioned.
- Machine learning benchmarks and tooling: Mentioned indirectly through Kaggle competition and assignment grading【6:1†source】.

Overall score: **2** (Infrequent)

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
2.1 The impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML are not comprehensively defined or explained in the syllabus. The detailed explanations for most of the topics are missing, aside from general implementation details of deep learning. 

Overall score: **2** (Inadequate)

2.2 The topics explicitly discussed related to "computing systems" are:
- Scalable model training and inference
- General machine learning implementations
- Kaggle competition for practical benchmarking

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
3.1 The computational performance and capability requirements are not specified in quantitative terms in the syllabuses. There are more qualitative descriptions of implementations and usage.

Overall score: **2** (Qualitatively)

3.2 The discussion of “computing system” requirements as compared to general AI/ML topics is more of a sub-topic.

Overall score: **2** (“computing system” requirements is a sub-topic)

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
4.1 The importance of various “computing system” factors is viewed more as low-level systems issues. Detailed and holistic discussions are not apparent in the syllabus.

Overall score: **1** (System)

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
5.1 Real-world case studies are included mainly through Kaggle competitions, but the computational performance and capability of the underlying systems are not the primary concerns.

Overall score: **1** (Minor)

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
6.1 The courses mention the importance of implementations and certain practices, but do not cover contributions from AI/ML system engineering communities in sufficient depth.

Overall score: **2** (Inadequate)

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
7.1 The assignments involve the practical implementation of deep learning models and evaluations primarily through Kaggle. However, hands-on experience with specific areas like compiler optimization, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization is minimally addressed.

Overall score: **2** (Inadequate)
