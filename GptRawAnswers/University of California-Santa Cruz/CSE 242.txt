### Research Questions Analysis for Course Syllabus

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
1.1 Based on the discussion of topics explicitly related to "computing systems" specialized for ML/AI:
- Scalable model training, inference, testing, debugging, monitoring of ML applications, ML programming models and abstractions, programming languages for ML, ML compilers and runtimes, specialized hardware for ML, hardware-efficient ML methods, machine learning benchmarks, and tooling are **not frequently covered**.
- Score: **Infrequent (2)**.

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
2.1 Evaluation of how the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML are defined and explained:
- The syllabus does not **adequately define** and explain many of these topics.
- Score: **Undefined (1)**.

2.2 List of topics discussed:
- None of the critical components related to computing systems such as ML compilers, runtimes, specialized hardware, or scalable model training have been explicitly mentioned.

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
3.1 Discussion of computational performance and capability requirements:
- This course does not provide **quantitative specifications** or detailed numeric guidelines for computational performance and capability requirements.
- Score: **No guidelines (1)**.

3.2 Rank of "computing system" requirement discussions:
- The "computing system" requirements appear to be **sub-topics that do not receive equal discussion** compared to general AI/ML topics.
- Score: **Sub-topic (2)**.

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
4.1 Emphasis on importance of "computing system" factors:
- The course appears to adopt a **system view**, understanding computing system factors as low-level system issues.
- Score: **System (1)**.

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
5.1 Inclusion of real-world case studies:
- There is no significant mention of **case studies focusing on hardware/software systems for scalable AI/ML**.
- Score: **Minor (1)**.

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
6.1 Coverage of contributions from AI/ML system engineering communities:
- The course does not provide **adequate coverage** of contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities.
- Score: **Undefined (1)**.

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
7.1 Hands-on experience with designing scalable AI/ML systems:
- The syllabus does not provide enough information to ascertain the **practical implementation focus** on hardware/software system design for AI/ML.
- Score: **Could not be evaluated (0)**.
