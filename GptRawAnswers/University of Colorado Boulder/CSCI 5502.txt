### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency

**Score**: **1 - Never mentioned**

The attached syllabus does not explicitly cover topics specialized for ML/AI such as scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; ML programming models and abstractions; programming languages for machine learning; ML compilers and runtimes; specialized hardware for machine learning; hardware-efficient ML methods; machine learning benchmarks, and tooling   .

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding

**Score 2.1**: **1 - Undefined**

Impact of computing systems on AI/ML is mostly undefined as there is no detailed content in the syllabus addressing the impact of specialized computing systems for AI/ML   .

**Score 2.2**: 

The syllabus does not include a comprehensive and explicit definition of the impact of computing systems on AI/ML for any of the following topics:
1. Scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference
2. Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
3. ML programming models and abstractions
4. Programming languages for machine learning
5. ML compilers and runtimes
6. Specialized hardware for machine learning
7. Hardware-efficient ML methods
8. Machine learning benchmarks and tooling   .

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification

**Score 3.1**: **1 - No guidelines**

The syllabus does not include guidelines or discussions specifying computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML   .

**Score 3.2**: **1 - “computing system” requirements were never discussed**

The discussion of “computing system” requirements is absent compared to general AI/ML topics in the syllabus   .

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance

**Score 4.1**: **1 - System**

The course views the computing system factors as low-level system issues, relegating responsibility to the correct choice of hardware, programming model, and AI/ML framework   .

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications

**Score 5.1**: **1 - Minor**

Real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving, are not a major focus in the curriculum of the syllabus provided   .

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices

**Score 6.1**: **1 - Undefined**

The courses do not clearly discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization   .

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation

**Score 7.1**: **2 - Inadequate**

While the course includes projects and a project proposal, the assignments do not specifically provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML   .
