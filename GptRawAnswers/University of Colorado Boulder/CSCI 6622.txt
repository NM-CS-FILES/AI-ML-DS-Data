Based on the syllabus file provided, here are the answers to each research question:

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency
**1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course?**
- Score: 2 (Infrequent)

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding
**2.1 How are the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula?**
- Score: 2 (Inadequate)

**2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?**
- Discussed Topics: `scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; ML programming models and abstractions; specialized hardware for machine learning; machine learning benchmarks`.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification
**3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?**
- Score: 2 (Qualitatively)

**3.2 How did the discussion of "computing system" requirements rank against the discussion of general AI/ML topics?**
- Score: 2 (“computing system” requirements is a sub-topic)

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance
**4.1 How is the importance of various "computing system" factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course?**
- Score: 1 (System)

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
**5.1 Are real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving explicitly included in the curriculum?**
- Score: 1 (Minor)

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices
**6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization?**
- Score: 2 (Inadequate)

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation
**7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML, specifically focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML?**
- Score: 0 (Could not be evaluated)
