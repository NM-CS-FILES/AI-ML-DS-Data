Below is the detailed analysis of the course syllabus based on the provided research questions (RQs):

**RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:**
- Overall, topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI are discussed infrequently in the course.
- Rating: **Infrequent (2)**

**RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:**
- The impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML are generally inadequately defined and explained in undergraduate curricula, with many significant discussions missed in lectures or assignments.
- Rating: **Inadequate (2)**
- The following topics are addressed in the course:
  - Scalable (parallel and distributed) model training
  - Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
  - ML programming models and abstractions
  - Programming languages for machine learning
  - Specialized hardware for machine learning
  - Hardware-efficient ML methods
  - Machine learning benchmarks

**RQ 3. Requirement Specification:**
- Computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML are discussed qualitatively in an inadequate manner.
- Rating: **Qualitatively (2)**
- The discussion of “computing system” requirements ranks as a subtopic compared to the discussion of general AI/ML topics.
- Rating: **Sub topic (2)**

**RQ 4. Influence and Importance:**
- The course takes into account many of the important “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML holistically.
- Rating: **Holistic (2)**

**RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:**
- Real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving, are a minor concern in the curriculum.
- Rating: **Minor (1)**

**RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:**
- The courses mention contributions from AI/ML system engineering communities, but do not cover in sufficient depth or detail.
- Rating: **Inadequate (2)**

**RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:**
- The assignments in the course provide minimal coverage and insufficient hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML.
- Rating: **Inadequate (2)**

**Conclusion:**
The course partially covers the required topics but does not provide exhaustive or detailed discussions on the computational systems tailored for scalable AI/ML. The implementation aspects through assignments are also minimal, emphasizing the need for a deeper focus on these critical areas.
