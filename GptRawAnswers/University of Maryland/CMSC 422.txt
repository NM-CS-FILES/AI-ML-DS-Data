Based on the provided course syllabus for CMSC 422, here are the detailed answers to the research questions regarding computing systems tailored for AI/ML scalability:

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
**1.1 Frequency of "computing system" specialized topics:**
- Scalable model training, inference
- Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
- ML programming models and abstractions
- Programming languages for machine learning
- ML compilers and runtimes
- Specialized hardware for machine learning
- Hardware-efficient ML methods
- Machine learning benchmarks and tooling

**Rating: Infrequent (2)**
The course predominantly covers general machine learning methods and algorithms, with minimal explicit mention of computing systems specialized for AI/ML   .

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
**2.1 Definition and understanding of "computing systems" impacts:**
**Rating: Inadequate (2)**
Many of the topics concerning computing systems are either missed or not significantly discussed in the course lectures or assignments   .

**2.2 Comprehensive and explicit definitions:**
**Discussed Topics:**
- None of the topics explicitly listed are covered comprehensively. The syllabus focuses more on traditional machine learning algorithms and methods rather than the computational systems' impact.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
**3.1 Specification and discussion of computational performance and capability requirements:**
**Rating: No guidelines (1)**
There are no specific guidelines provided regarding computational performance or capability requirements like latency, throughput, or resource utilization for AI/ML systems   .

**3.2 Ranking of "computing system" requirements against general AI/ML topics:**
**Rating: "computing system" requirements is a sub topic (2)**
The syllabus treats computing system requirements as a minor sub-topic compared to the general AI/ML topics.

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
**4.1 Emphasis on importance of "computing system" factors:**
**Rating: System (1)**
The factors are not viewed holistically and are relegated to low-level system issues, focusing more on general ML algorithms and techniques  .

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
**5.1 Inclusion of real-world case studies on hardware and software systems for AI/ML:**
**Rating: Minor (1)**
Computational performance and capability of the underlying system are not major concerns of the case studies mentioned; the focus remains on the machine learning aspects  .

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices:
**6.1 Discussion on contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities:**
**Rating: Undefined (1)**
The coverage of this topic in the courses is unclear or not well-defined. The focus remains heavily on machine learning algorithms rather than system engineering practices  .

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation:
**7.1 Hands-on experience in assignments with designing, building, and maintaining scalable hardware and software systems:**
**Rating: None (1)**
The assignments do not appear to cover the relevant areas of compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML, based on the provided information  .
