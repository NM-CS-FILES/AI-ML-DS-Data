### Detailed Breakdown

**Course Content Related to Computing Systems:**
- The syllabus mentions topics such as "Computational Infrastructure" and "Introduction to PyTorch," which suggests some discussion on computing systems but not extensively.
- TA lectures cover implementation basics and computational resources briefly .
- Practical code structuring and handling of data (images, text) using platforms like Colaboratory and Google Cloud Platform are included but computing system specifics are minimal  .

**Missed or Under-Emphasized Topics:**
- The syllabus does not cover specialized hardware for machine learning, such as GPUs or TPUs, in detail.
- There is no deep dive into ML compilers and runtime systems.
- Discussions on testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications are limited.
- The focus on scalable model training and hardware efficiency is minimal.
- Best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization, are not well-defined.

**Hands-On Experience and Assignments:**
- Assignments are more focused on conceptual understanding and implementation of neural networks rather than on hardware or optimizing computing systems for AI/ML purposes.
- No explicit projects or assignments listed provide hands-on experience with compiler optimization, runtime systems, or hardware acceleration.

**Real-World Applications and Practical Examples:**
- Case studies or examples emphasizing the computational performance and capability of the underlying systems for scalable AI/ML were not highlighted.

Based on the content and details presented, this syllabus provides a foundational understanding of deep learning with limited integration of computing system specifics necessary for scalable AI/ML applications. Therefore, the course primarily views computing system factors from a basic implementation perspective.
