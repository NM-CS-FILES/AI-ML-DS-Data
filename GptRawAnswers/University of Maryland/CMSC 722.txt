### RQ 1: Course Content and Frequency

**Likert Scale:**  
1.1 The frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course: **Infrequent (2)**. 

### RQ 2: Definition and Understanding

**Likert Scale:**  
2.1 The impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML are explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula: **Undefined (1)**.

**Topics Discussed:**
- The syllabus does not provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML.

### RQ 3: Requirement Specification

**Likert Scale:**  
3.1 How computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML are explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses: **No guidelines (1)**.

3.2 The discussion of “computing system” requirements against the discussion of general AI/ML topics: **“computing system” requirements is a sub topic (2)**.

### RQ 4: Influence and Importance

**Likert Scale:**  
4.1 The importance of various “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course: **System (1)**.

### RQ 5: Case Studies and Real-World Applications

**Likert Scale:**  
5.1 Real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving explicitly included in the curriculum: **Minor (1)**.

### RQ 6: Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices

**Likert Scale:**  
6.1 The courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization: **Undefined (1)**.

### RQ 7: Projects and Practical Implementation

**Likert Scale:**  
7.1 The extent to which the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML: **None (1)**.

### Summary
The provided syllabus focuses insufficiently on computing systems tailored for AI/ML scalability. The course does not comprehensively address impacts, computational performance, or specific engineering practices related to computing systems in the context of AI/ML. Additionally, it lacks extensive hands-on projects that would provide practical experience in these areas. Frequent, detailed inclusion of these aspects could enhance the course's ability to prepare students for the unique challenges of scalable AI/ML systems.
