Based on the content of the uploaded syllabus, here's the detailed analysis of the research questions (RQ) related to "computing systems" for AI/ML scalability:

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency
**Score:** 1 (Never mentioned)

Upon reviewing the syllabus, topics such as scalable model training, ML compilers and runtimes, specialized hardware for machine learning, and other computing system-related topics specialized for ML/AI were not explicitly found in the course descriptions or lecture titles.

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding
**Score:** 1 (Undefined)

The syllabus does not provide explicit definitions or detailed explanations regarding the impacts of computing systems on AI/ML, including any mention of scalable model training, debugging, ML programming models, compilers, specialized hardware, or ML benchmarks.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification
3.1 **Score:** 1 (No guidelines)
The syllabus does not specify computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML. No numerical or qualitative guidelines were found.

3.2 **Score:** 1 (Computing system requirements were never discussed)
The syllabus does not provide discussions on computing system requirements in the context of scalable AI/ML compared to general AI/ML topics.

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance
**Score:** 1 (System)
The course appears to consider computing system factors as low-level system issues, without incorporating many of the crucial factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML explicitly.

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
**Score:** 1 (Minor)
There are no explicit case studies included in the curriculum that focus on hardware and software systems for scalable model training, inference, or serving in AI/ML.

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices
**Score:** 1 (Undefined)
The courses do not seem to discuss the contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, especially in areas like compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization.

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation
**Score:** 0 (Could not be evaluated)
Due to insufficient information on assignments within the syllabus, it is challenging to evaluate how well the assignments provide hands-on experience with designing and maintaining scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML.

### Summary of Course Coverage
The syllabus focuses on data science fundamentals, algorithms, matrix factorization, spectral graph theory, and optimization techniques without diving into specifics of computing systems tailored for AI/ML. The provided content does not include significant discussions on scalable training, testing and monitoring, ML programming models, compilers, specialized hardware, or hardware-efficient methods   .

The detailed findings indicate a need for integrating more advanced and specialized computing systems topics related to AI/ML scalability into the current curriculum to address the gap.
