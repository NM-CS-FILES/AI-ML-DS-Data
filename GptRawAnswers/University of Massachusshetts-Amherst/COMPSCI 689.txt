Based on a detailed review of the provided syllabus, here are the answers to the research questions as requested:

### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency

**1.1 Frequency of Computing System Topics Related to ML/AI:**
The topics explicitly related to computing systems specialized for ML/AI are discussed intermittently in the course. The syllabus mentions the use of Python and implementation of machine learning algorithms, but there is no clear indication that topics like specialized hardware for ML, ML compilers and runtimes, or hardware-efficient ML methods are dedicatedly covered.

**Likert Scale Rating: 3 (Intermittent)**

### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding

**2.1 Definition and Explanation of Computing Systems Impact on AI/ML:**
The course does provide details on deriving and implementing machine learning algorithms, but it seems to miss significant in-depth discussion on many specific computing system topics such as ML compilers, runtimes, and specialized hardware.

**Likert Scale Rating: 2 (Inadequate)**

**2.2 Comprehensive Definition Provided:**
The syllabus includes the following topics implicitly related to computing systems for AI/ML:
- Implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Mathematical foundations, which may involve some aspects of computational efficiency indirectly.

**Discussed Topics:**
1. Mathematical foundations of numerical optimization.
2. Implementing machine learning algorithms.

### RQ 3. Requirement Specification

**3.1 Specification and Discussion of Computational Performance and Capability Requirements:**
The course lightly touches on optimizing code using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch which is more qualitative.

**Likert Scale Rating: 2 (Qualitative)**

**3.2 Comparison of Computing System Requirements with General AI/ML Topics:**
The course discussions are mainly centered on mathematical foundations and implementations of machine learning algorithms rather than a balanced focus on computing systems.

**Likert Scale Rating: 2 ("computing system" requirements are a sub-topic)**

### RQ 4. Influence and Importance

**4.1 Emphasis on Computing System Factors:**
The course integrates some factors of computing systems, especially in terms of implementing learning algorithms and optimizing performance, but it is done mostly from a mathematical and algorithmic perspective.

**Likert Scale Rating: 1 (System)**

### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications

**5.1 Inclusion of Real-World Case Studies:**
The syllabus does not explicitly mention case studies focusing on computational performance and capability of underlying hardware and software systems for AI/ML.

**Likert Scale Rating: 1 (Minor)**

### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices

**6.1 Discussion of AI/ML System Engineering Contributions and Best Practices:**
The syllabus slightly touches on optimization practices using existing libraries but lacks depth in areas like compilers, runtime systems, and hardware acceleration.

**Likert Scale Rating: 2 (Inadequate)**

### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation

**7.1 Hands-on Experience with Designing, Building, and Maintaining Scalable Systems:**
The primary focus seems to be on coding machine learning algorithms and mathematical foundations rather than extensive hands-on projects related to compiler optimization or hardware acceleration.

**Likert Scale Rating: 2 (Inadequate)**

These conclusions are based on the material sampled from the syllabus. For a precise reflection of the entire course, consulting the complete detailed syllabus with emphasis on weekly topics, readings, and assignments would be recommended.
