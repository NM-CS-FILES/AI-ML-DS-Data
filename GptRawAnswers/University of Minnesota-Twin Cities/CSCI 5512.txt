### Detailed Answers to Research Questions (RQ)

#### RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency
**1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (Never mentioned)

The syllabus primarily focuses on general AI concepts such as learning, neural networks, natural language understanding, planning, and reasoning with uncertainty without explicitly addressing the topics associated with "computing system" specialized for ML/AI.

#### RQ 2. Definition and Understanding
**2.1 How are the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (Undefined)

The syllabus does not provide detailed definitions or explanations concerning the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML. The main focus is on advanced topics in AI without discussing specific "computing system" impacts.

**2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?**

Only general AI topics such as learning and neural networks are listed:

1. Scaling (parallel and distributed) model training, inference
2. Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
3. ML programming models and abstractions
4. Programming languages for machine learning
5. ML compilers and runtimes
6. Specialized hardware for machine learning
7. Hardware-efficient ML methods
8. Machine learning benchmarks, and tooling

The above topics are not explicitly covered in the syllabus【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】.

#### RQ 3. Requirement Specification
**3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (No guidelines)

The syllabus lacks any mention of computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems relevant to scalable AI/ML. There is no numeric or qualitative discussion of performance and capability parameters【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】.

**3.2 How did the discussion of “computing system” requirements rank against the discussion of general AI/ML topics?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (Never discussed)

Computing system requirements like computational power and distributed computing frameworks are not discussed compared to general AI/ML topics covered in the syllabus【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】.

#### RQ 4. Influence and Importance
**4.1 How is the importance of various “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (System)

The course views computing system factors such as scalable model training, specialized hardware, and ML compilers as low-level system issues, and these are not prominently featured in the curriculum【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】.

#### RQ 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
**5.1 Are real-world case studies involving hardware and software systems for AI/ML, with a focus on scalable model training, inference, and serving explicitly included in the curriculum?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (Minor)

There is no mention of real-world case studies that focus on the computational performance and capability of underlying systems in AI/ML specific contexts within the syllabus【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】.

#### RQ 6. Awareness and Integration of AI-Specific Engineering Practices
**6.1 Do the courses discuss contributions and best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities, specifically in areas such as compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, and code optimization?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (Undefined)

The syllabus does not cover contributions or best practices from AI/ML system engineering communities related to compilers, runtimes, hardware acceleration, and code optimization【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】.

#### RQ 7. Projects and Practical Implementation
**7.1 To what extent do the assignments in the course provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining both scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML, specifically focusing on compiler optimization, optimizing runtime systems, hardware acceleration, or code optimization for AI/ML?**

**Likert Scale**: 1 (None)

The assignments detailed in the syllabus do not provide hands-on experience with designing, building, and maintaining scalable hardware and software systems for AI/ML focusing on the specified areas【6:0†CSCI 5512.pdf】. 

---

In summary, the syllabus mostly focuses on advanced topics in AI and lacks details on computing systems specialized for machine learning and AI scalability requirements.
