cover. 
If you have not taken 4771 and want to take Advanced
Machine Learning, we may make an exception for you if you have a
strong background and are eager to catch up. To brush up on
background material for Advanced Machine Learning, look at the
slides and handouts for introductory Machine Learning 
COMS4771. 
Bulletin Board: 
Class bulletin board (Click on Discussion) 
The course will sometimes refer to the online text book Introduction
to Graphical Models by M.I. Jordan. The book is available via
courseworks.columbia.edu for registered students only. 
Academic Honesty Policy: Please read the policy 
here.
 By staying
registered in the class you indicate your acceptance of all its
terms. 
We do not accept late homework or absence without official
reasons (medical, etc.) approved by a student dean. If you miss
class, please coordinate with colleagues to find out what you
missed (do not email the professor to help you catch up). Once a
particular grade is posted for you on Courseworks, you have two
weeks to contest it. Afterwards, these grades cannot be changed
(do not wait until the end of the semester to contest any grading
issues that are more than two weeks old). This course assumes you
have the ability to upload your work via courseworks and can figure
out how to attach files. If you are incapable of using courseworks,
unable to program, or unable to follow mathematical notation,
please drop the class. If you find any of these terms unacceptable,
please drop the class. 
This 3 credit course (4772 or 6772 are equivalent) satisfies: 
a PhD Elective in the Advanced AI track. 
a Required or Elective Course for the MS Machine Learning track. 
an Elective Course for the MS Vision/Graphics track.

===================[Syllabus End]===================
Please examine the attached course syllabus carefully and provide detailed answers to the research questions (RQ) listed below. Each question focuses on specific aspects of "computing systems" tailored for AI/ML scalability. We are looking for specific issues and topics related to compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, code optimization, programming model for AI/ML covered in the syllabus. Programming with Python or jupyter does not count as computing system topics.

RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course? 
The topics are 1) scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; 3) ML programming models and abstractions; 4) programming languages for machine learning; 5) ML compilers and runtimes; 6) specialized hardware for machine learning; 7) hardware-efficient ML methods; 8) machine learning benchmarks, and tooling.
Answer in likert scale: 
Frequent (4): At least one dedicated lecture discussed the topics.
Intermittent (3): The topics are discussed occasionally. 
Infrequent (2): The topics are rarely mentioned.
Never mentioned (1): The topics are never mentioned.
Provide the score based on overall discussion of the above topics. Do not rate each topic individually. No explanation needed.
RQ 2. Definition and Understanding:
2.1 How are the impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML explicitly defined and explained in undergraduate curricula? 
The definition and explanation should include concepts of 1) scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; 3) ML programming models and abstractions; 4) programming languages for machine learning; 5) ML compilers and runtimes; 6) specialized hardware for machine learning; 7) hardware-efficient ML methods; 8) machine learning benchmarks, and tooling.
Answer in Likert scale: 
Adequate (3): Provide detailed definition and explanation.
Inadequate (2): Many of the topics missed significant discussion in lectures or in assignments.
Undefined (1): The topics are mostly undefined.
Provide the score based on overall discussion of the above topics. Do not rate each topic individually. No explanation needed.
2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?
The definition and explanation should include concepts such as 1) scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; 3) ML programming models and abstractions; 4) programming languages for machine learning; 5) ML compilers and runtimes; 6) specialized hardware for machine learning; 7) hardware-efficient ML methods; 8) machine learning benchmarks, and tooling.
Answer by providing the list of above topics (1 to 9) discussed in the course. Make it short and direct. Limit in 100 words. Do not include topics unrelated to "computing systems" like general ML/AI algorithms.

RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?
Topics include 1) Computational Power (CPU, GPU, TPU, Edge AI chips), Memory and Storage, Network for scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) Distributed Computing Frameworks such as TensorFlow's Distributed Strategy, PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and Horovod 3)  Optimization Techniques such as Efficient Algorithm, Quantization, Prunning 4) Programming Models and Abstractions such as High-Level Libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras)
Answer in Likert scale:
