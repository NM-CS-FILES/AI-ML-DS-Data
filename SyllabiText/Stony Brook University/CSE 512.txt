This page provides some information to students who are considering to enroll in the course. Below are tentative grading scheme and
syllabus, which are subject to change. Once you have enrolled in the course, you should go to Blackboard for updated information
and futher annoucements. The content of this page will not be updated two weeks after the course has begun.
This course covers fundamental machine learning concepts for intelligent systems that autonomously learn to perform a task and improve
with experience, including problem formulations (e.g., selecting input features and outputs) and learning frameworks (e.g., supervised vs.
unsupervised), standard models, methods, computational tools, algorithms and modern techniques, as well as methodologies to evaluate
learning ability and to automatically select optimal models. Applications to areas such as computer vision (e.g., image classification,
object detection) and medical data analysis (e.g., Covid-19 prediction) will motivate the coursework and material.
This course is intended for graduate students who already have good programming skills and adequate background knowledge in
mathematics, including probability, statistics, and linear algebra. This course is offered by the Department of Computer Science, and
students from the department will have priority in registering for this course. 
If there are still spaces, students from AMS and BMI will be
given special permission to enroll. Students from other departments won't be able to enroll in this course due to resource constraint. For
special permission to enroll, attend the few two weeks of lectures (using the Zoom link provided in the Google doc above), and I will tell
you how to enroll in the course at the end of the second week if: 1) you are still interested in taking the course, and 2) spaces are still
available.
Grading
There will be 5-6 homework assignments, two midterm exams, and several class quizzes.
Homework assignments: 50%
Five to six homework assignments
Exams and Quizzes: 50%
Class quizzes: 10%
Midterm 1: 20%
Midterm 2: 20%
No final exam. No final project.
Weights are approximate and subject to change. You are expected to do homework assignments by yourselves. Even if you discuss
them with your classmates, you should turn in your own code and write-up. You can have one sheet of paper with notes in the exams.

Final lecture - course review
 
Students who are enrolled in the in-person/hybrid session of this course must attend at least two out of three in-person sessions,
which are highlighted in the above table. 
Students who fail to do so will not receive a passing grade. In-person sessions are held
during the regular class hours, in Room 120 of the New Computer Science building (NCS 120). You must physically be in NCS 120
during the in-person sessions, but you will be watching synchronous Zoom lectures on your own computers. 
Bring your own
computers and headphones.
Textbooks
Textbooks are optional.

Undergraduate Class Schedule, and the Faculty-Employee Handbook.
Attendance and Covid-19
Students are expected to attend every class, report for examinations and submit major graded coursework as scheduled. If a student is
unable to attend lecture(s), report for any exams or complete major graded coursework as scheduled due to extenuating circumstances,
the student must contact the instructor as soon as possible. 
Students may be requested to provide documentation to support their
absence and/or may be referred to the Student Support Team for assistance. Students will be provided reasonable accommodations for
missed exams, assignments or projects due to significant illness, tragedy or other personal emergencies. In the instance of missed lectures
or labs, the student is responsible for insert course specific information here (examples include: review posted slides, review recorded
lectures, seek notes from a classmate or identified class note taker, write lab report based on sample data).
