Course Description
Data Mining (DM), called also Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is a multidisciplinary Ô¨Åeld. It brings
together research and ideas from database technology, machine learning, neural networks, statistics, pattern
recognition, knowledge based systems, information retrieval, high-performance computing, and data visu-
alization. Its main focus is the automated extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored in
large databases, data warehouses, and other massive information repositories.
The course will closely follow the book and is designed to give a broad, yet in-depth overview of the Data
Mining Ô¨Åeld and examine the most recognized techniques in a more rigorous detail. We also will explore the
newest trends and developments of the Ô¨Åeld. In particular we will cover all or part of the following subjects
Grading General Principles
1. TEST 1 andTEST 2 are IN CLASS tests
2.PROJECT, FINAL REPORT PRESENTATION and FINAL REPORT PAPER are to be conducted in Teams of
4 - 5 students
3.All members of the Team receive the same grade
4. NONE of the grades will be curved
Teams Formation
Please email TA (to be speciÔ¨Åed later) names, IDs, and emails of your Team members denoting who is the
designated Team Leader . TA will assign a Team Number to each Team and email it to each Team Leader
to be used for future identiÔ¨Åcation.
Contact the TA if you do not have a team partner. He will help you to FORM a Team
Make-up Exams
Make-up exams will be given only in extenuating circumstances (e.g., doctor‚Äôs note stating that you were ill and
unÔ¨Åt to take the exam). Students who miss an exam for a valid reason must contact the instructor immediately
to take a make-up exam at the earliest possible time; speciÔ¨Åc arrangements will be made on a case-by-case
basis.
