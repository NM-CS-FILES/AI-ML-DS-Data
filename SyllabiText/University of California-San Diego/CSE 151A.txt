Syllabus
The goal of this class is to provide a broad introduction to machine-learning. The topics covered in this class include some
topics in supervised learning, such as k-nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, boosting and perceptrons, and topics in
unsupervised learning, such as k-means, and hierarchical clustering.
The topics covered in this class will be different from those covered in CSE 150. In addition to the actual algorithms, we
will be focussing on the principles behind the algorithms in this class.

===================[Syllabus End]===================
Please examine the attached course syllabus carefully and provide detailed answers to the research questions (RQ) listed below. Each question focuses on specific aspects of "computing systems" tailored for AI/ML scalability. We are looking for specific issues and topics related to compilers, runtime systems, hardware acceleration, code optimization, programming model for AI/ML covered in the syllabus. Programming with Python or jupyter does not count as computing system topics.

RQ 1. Course Content and Frequency:
1.1 How frequently are topics explicitly related to "computing system" specialized for ML/AI discussed in the course? 
The topics are 1) scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; 3) ML programming models and abstractions; 4) programming languages for machine learning; 5) ML compilers and runtimes; 6) specialized hardware for machine learning; 7) hardware-efficient ML methods; 8) machine learning benchmarks, and tooling.
Answer in likert scale: 
Frequent (4): At least one dedicated lecture discussed the topics.
