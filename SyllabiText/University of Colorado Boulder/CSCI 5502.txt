This course Introduces basic data mining concepts and techniques for discovering interesting patterns hidden 
in large-scale data sets, focusing on issues relating to eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency. Topics covered include data 
preprocessing, data warehouse, association, classiﬁcation, clustering, outlier detection, and mining speciﬁc 
data types such as time-series, social networks, multimedia, and Web data.

Course Policies 
Academic Integrity All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing 
and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may in-
clude: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threaten-
ing behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council 
(honor@colorado.edu ; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic in-
tegrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic 
sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other infor-
mation on the Honor Code can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and 
at http://honorcode.colorado.edu 
Classroom Behavior Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learn-
ing environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to dis-
cipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals 
and topics dealing with diﬀerences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veterans status, 
sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. 
Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your 
request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this prefer-
ence early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies 
at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at http://www.colorado.edu/

2 
Disability If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter 
from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one 
week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommo-
dations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at 
dsinfo@colorado.ed. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Con-
ditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines under Quick Links at Disability Services website 
and discuss your needs with your professor. 
Discrimination and Harassment The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to 
maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not 
discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orien-
tation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational 
programs and activities. (Regent Law, Article 10, amended 11/8/2001). CU-Boulder will not tolerate 
acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by 
any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, “Protected Classes” refers to race, 
color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against 
should contact the Oﬃce of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Oﬃce of 
Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, 
and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be 
obtained at http://hr.colorado.edu/dh/ 
Religious Observance Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every 
eﬀort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conﬂicts 
with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. In this class, students should notify the 
instructor at least one work before religious obligations that will interfere with required coursework.
