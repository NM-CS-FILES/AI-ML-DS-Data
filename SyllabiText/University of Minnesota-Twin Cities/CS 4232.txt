Late Policy
Assignments are to be submitted by the due date listed. 
Each person will be allowed 
three
 days of extensions 
which can be applied to any
combination of assignments 
(homework/projects/essays only) during the semester without penalty. 
After that a late penalty of 15% per day will be
assigned. 
Use of a partial day will be counted as a full day. 
Use of extension days must be stated explicitly at the 
time of the late submission (by
accompanying email to the TA), 
otherwise late penalties will apply. Extensions cannot be 
used after the final day of classes (ie., April 30). Extension
days cannot be rearranged after they are applied to a submission. 
Use them wisely!
Assignments will NOT BE accepted if they are more than five days late. 
Additional extensions will be granted only due to serious and documented
medical or family emergencies.
Academic Honesty
Please read the departmental 
academic integrity policy
. This will be followed unless we provide written documentation of exceptions. We
encourage you to interact amongst yourselves: you may discuss and obtain help with basic concepts covered in lectures or the textbook,
homework specification (but not solution), and program implementation (but not design). However, unless otherwise noted, work turned in should
reflect your own efforts and knowledge. Sharing or copying solutions is unacceptable and could result in failure. We use copy detection software,
so do not copy code and make changes (either from the Web or from other students). You are expected to take reasonable precautions to prevent
others from using your work.
Attendance Policy during COVID-19
Students are expected to attend all classes unless they are ill 
or otherwise unable to attend class. 
We provide both in-class and online ways to
attend the class. 
The Zoom information to attend the class online are listed in Brightspace. 
Either way students are expected to complete in-class
quizzes in a timely manner via HotSeat. 
If students feel ill, have any symptoms 
associated with COVID-19, or suspect they have been exposed to
the virus, 
students should stay home and contact the Protect Purdue Health Center (496-INFO).
Students need to inform the instructor 
of any conflict that can be anticipated and will affect the timely submission 
of an assignment or the ability to
take an exam due to COVID.
Classroom engagement is extremely important and associated with your overall success 
in the course. The importance and value of course
engagement and ways in which you can 
engage with the course content even if you are in quarantine or isolation, will be discussed 
at the beginning
of the semester. Student survey data from Fall 2020 emphasized studentsâ€™ 
views of in-person course opportunities as critical to their learning,
engagement with 
faculty/TAs, and ability to interact with peers.
Only the instructor can excuse a student from a course requirement or responsibility. 
When conflicts can be anticipated, such as for many
University-sponsored activities 
and religious observations, the student should inform the instructor of the situation 
as far in advance as possible. For
unanticipated or emergency conflicts, when advance 
notification to an instructor is not possible, the student should contact the
instructor/instructional team as soon as possible by email, through Brightspace, or by phone. 
In cases of bereavement, quarantine, or isolation, the
student or the studentâ€™s 
representative should contact the Office of the Dean of Students via email or phone 
at 765-494-1747. Our course
Brightspace includes a link to the Dean of Students under 
â€˜Campus Resources.â€™
Academic Guidance in the Event a Student is Quarantined/Isolated
If you must quarantine or isolate at any point in time during the semester, 
please reach out to all TAs and me via email so that we can communicate
about how you can 
continue to learn remotely. Work with the Protect Purdue Health Center (PPHC) 
to get documentation and support, including
access to an Academic Case Manager 
who can provide you with general guidelines/resources around 
communicating with your instructors, be
available for academic support, and offer 
suggestions for how to be successful when learning remotely. Your Academic Case Manager 
can be
reached at acmg@purdue.edu. Importantly, if you find yourself too sick 
to progress in the course, notify your academic case manager and notify
me 
via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation.
We provide a Zoom link to attend the class remotely in case of quarantine/isolation. 
The link can be accessed via Brightspace. The attendance is
usually taken via Hotseat, which 
can be accessed remotely as well.
Classroom Guidance Regarding Protect Purdue
The Protect Purdue Plan, which includes the Protect Purdue Pledge, is campus policy 
and as such all members of the Purdue community must
comply with the required health 
and safety guidelines. Required behaviors in this class include: staying home and 
contacting the Protect Purdue
Health Center (496-INFO) if you feel ill or know you 
have been exposed to the virus, properly wearing a mask in classrooms and campus
building, at all times (e.g., mask covers nose and mouth, no eating/drinking 
in the classroom), disinfecting desk/workspace before and after use,
maintaining 
appropriate social distancing with peers and instructors (including when entering/exiting 
classrooms), refraining from moving furniture,
avoiding shared use of personal items, 
maintaining robust hygiene (e.g., handwashing, disposal of tissues) prior to, during and 
after class, and
following all safety directions from the instructor.
Students who are not engaging in these behaviors (e.g., wearing a mask) will be offered 
the opportunity to comply. If non-compliance continues,
possible results include instructors 
asking the student to leave class and instructors dismissing the whole class. Students 
who do not comply with the
required health behaviors are violating the University Code 
of Conduct and will be reported to the Dean of Students Office with sanctions ranging
from educational requirements to dismissal from the university.
Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person in a campus room 
(e.g., classroom) is threatening the safety of others by not
complying (e.g., not properly 
wearing a mask) may leave the room without consequence. The student is encouraged to report 
the behavior to and
discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the 
option of reporting the behavior to the Office of the Student Rights and
Responsibilities. 
See also Purdue University Bill of Student Rights.
