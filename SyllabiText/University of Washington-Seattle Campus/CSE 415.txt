Homework (written)
Homework (written)
Individual assignments graded on correctness and due by 10pm on the day listed. Worth 50% of grade total. Make sure your
answers are selected and visible when you submit them.
You may handwrite and scan the homework if you would like, but the answers must be clearly visible (i.e. pencil may not work).
Unless the question asks you to justify your answers, please do not add any explanations.
When a question does ask you to justify your answer, it is enough to just provide justification for just the answer you chose.
Please make sure to add the corresponding question tag to your solution to make grading easier. This may be cumbersome but
will allow us to get you your homework grades more quickly.

, graded on completion, open for collaboration, and due at 10pm on the day of the subsequent lecture (no late days
accepted). (Because we have 30 days of class and only 20 lectures we'll release the due dates as the lectures are completed.)
Review the correct answers on gradescope or below after the submission date.
Each completed problem adds: (number of completed practice problems) * (10 / total number of practice problems) to your grade,
which will then be renormalized. (E.g. completing all of them is worth 10% of grade, in which case written and programming
assignments are worth 45% each.)

Submitting
Submitting
All work will be turned in electronically.
Assignments should be done individually unless otherwise specified. You may discuss the subject matter with other students in
the class, but all final answers must be your own work. You are expected to maintain the utmost level of academic integrity in
the course, pertinent to the 
Allen School's policy
 
(https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct)
 
on academic
misconduct.
Each student has six penalty-free late day for the whole quarter. Consecutive days off (weekends or holidays) count as one late
day. Other than that, any late submission will be penalized at 20 percent of the submitted grade per day (weekends count as
one day). (This should incentive you to attempt the assignments even if you submit them quite late).
If seventy percent of you complete the end-of-quarter evaluations everyone will get an additional late day.
The maximum late days that can be used per assignment is four.
You must link pages to questions for written assignments submitted to gradescope. You will lose 0.25 point off the assignment
if you do not do so. (For guidance 
watch this video
 
(https://youtu.be/u-pK4GzpId0)
 
on how to do this.)
COVID
COVID
Please stay home if you're ill. Lectures are recorded and most office hours are held remotely. If one of the course staff becomes ill
we will move the appropriate events online. Consult the 
UW policies
 
(https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/)
 
for more
information.
Grade
Grade
Your grade will be the proportion of points you achieve for the projects and the homework, each set weighted by one half.
Additionally, completing practice problems will decrease the weight of the projects and homework, at a maximum of ten
percent of the total.
Practice problems are not extra credit. Your grade will be renormalized (set to the range of \([0, 1]\)) based on how many
you complete.
That is, their effect will be exponentially discounted as you approach a perfect score.
There will be no curve. Rather, your grade will be rounded to the highest decimal point out of four.
(The one possible exception to this is that no student gets a 4.0 in which case we would then increase every student's
grade by the difference between the highest scoring student and 4.0. We do not expect this to happen but will alert you if
there is an assignment for which the max score is greater than the maximum achieved score which would be a proxy for
such an event.)
If you're interested in specifics, we will use the following formula to calculate your grade:
\( total_{hw} = \frac{1}{2 \times \sum_{i \in HW} max_{hw_i}} \sum_{i \in HW} (points_{hw_i} \times \frac{1}{5} late_{hw_i}),
\)
\( total_{pr} = \frac{1}{2 \times \sum_{i \in PR} max_{pr_i}} \sum_{i \in PR} (points_{pr_i} \times \frac{1}{5} late_{pr_i}), \)
\( grade = \bigg \lceil \frac{ total_{hw} + total_{pr} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|PP|} pp_i}{10|PP|}}{1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|PP|} pp_i}
{10|PP|}} \times 40 \bigg \rceil / 10.0 ,\)
where the homework and project scores are \(points_{hw,pr} \in \mathbf{N}\), the maximum achievable scores are \
(max_{hw,pr} \in \mathbf{N}\), each practice problem is \(pp \in \{0,1\}\), and each day late for an assignment \(late_{hw,pr}
\in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), counting contiguous days off (holidays and weekends) as one and late days only applied to the first
(and all subsequent) assignments after your total late days number greater than six.
