About the Course and Prerequisites
About the Course and Prerequisites
Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from historical data and make inferences about
future outcomes. 
This study is a marriage of algorithms, computation, and statistics so this class will be have healthy doses of
each. 
The goals of this course are to provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental methodologies and algorithms of machine
learning.
Prerequisites: Students entering the class should be comfortable with programming and should have a pre-existing working
knowledge of linear algebra (MATH 308), vector calculus (MATH 324), probability and statistics (MATH 394/STAT390), and
algorithms. For a brief refresher I recommend you consult the linear algebra and statistics/probability reference materials below.

Discussion Forum and Email Communication
Discussion Forum and Email Communication
IMPORTANT: This class uses Mattermost (a secure Slack clone). An invite link will be available on the Canvas Discussion board. If
not registered for the course, please request an invite link by sending an email to cse546-instructors@cs.washington.edu. 
All class
announcements will be broadcasted on mattermost and you are responsible for keeping up to date on it (I suggest you turn on
push notifications). The same applies to questions about homeworks, projects and lectures. Mattermost lowers the barrier to
asking for help and encourages more interaction. 
It is also a place where students who are not registered can interact with the rest
of the class (unlike Canvas). 
Please ask all course-related questions in a public channel on Mattermost as other students will oQen
have the same question, or know the answer. 
If you have a question of personal matters, please email the instructors list: cse546-
instructors@cs.washington.edu.
Grading and Evaluation
Grading and Evaluation
Your grade will be based on 5 homework assignments (65%) and a final project (35%).
Homework

There are a number of Latex
resources above. Also note that LaTeX is installed on department-run machines.
The first homework (10 points) is designed to be a 
review
review
 
of the course prerequisites. 
If this assignment requires significant e?ort
(e.g., several hours) or contains unfamiliar topics, you should strongly consider dropping the course and revisiting the
prerequisites. 
Its secondary purpose to get you comfortable with Python and Latex.
COLLABORATION POLICY
COLLABORATION POLICY
: Homework must be done individually: each student must submit their own answers. In addition, each
student must write and submit their own code in the programming part of the assignment (we may run your code). It is acceptable,
however, for students to collaborate in figuring out answers and helping each other solve the problems. You must also indicate on
each homework with whom you collaborated.
RE-GRADING POLICY
RE-GRADING POLICY
: All requests for regrading should be submitted to Gradescope directly. O?ice hours and in person
discussions are limited solely to asking knowledge related questions, not grade related questions. If you feel that we have made an
error in grading your homework, please let us know with a written explanation, and we will consider the request. Please note that
regrading of a homework means the entire assignment may be regraded which may cause your grade on the entire homework set
to go up or down.
LATE POLICY
LATE POLICY
: Homeworks must be submitted online by the posted due date. With the exception of the poster presentation, all
work is to be submitted online. 
There is no credit for late work.
There is no credit for late work.
 
The homework scoring system of above is an attempt to minimize
the rigidness of this policy. We may make special arrangements for alternative dates for poster presentation (contact the
instructors). 
If you are unable to meet the deadlines due to travel, conferences, other deadlines, or any other reason, do not enroll
in the class.
HONOR CODE
HONOR CODE
: As we sometimes reuse problem set questions from previous years, covered by papers and webpages, we expect
the students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers (referring to unauthorized material is
considered a violation of the honor code). Similarly, we expect students not to google directly for answers. The homework is to
help you think about the material, and we expect you to make an honest e?ort to solve the problems. If you do happen to use
other material, it must be acknowledged clearly with a citation on the submitted solution. For more information, please see the
CSE Academic Misconduct policy
 
(https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/policies/misconduct)
 
that this course adheres to.
Project
Project
You will work independently or with a partner on a machine learning project spanning most of the quarter ending with a poster
presentation and written report. 
You may use techniques developed in this course but are also encouraged to learn and apply new
methods. The project should address a novel question with a non-obvious answer and must have a real-data component. We will
provide some seed project ideas. 
You can pick one of these ideas, and explore the data and algorithms within and beyond what we
suggest. 
You can also use your own data/ideas, but, in this case, you have to make sure you have the data available at the time of
the proposal and a nice roadmap, since a quarter is too short to explore a brand new concept. 
The components of the project are
Project Proposal (10 points)
Project Proposal (10 points)
: A one page maximum description of your project with: 1) project title, 2) dataset(s), 3) Project
idea (two paragraphs), 4) SoQware you will write and/or use, 5) papers to read (include 1-3 relevant papers), 6) will you have a
teammate?, and 7) what will you complete by the milestone (experimental results are expected)?
Project Milestone (15 points)
Project Milestone (15 points)
: Your write up should be 3 pages maximum (not including references) in 
Camera-ready NIPS
format
 
(https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles)
. You should describe the results of your first
experiments here and what you wish to accomplish before the final presentation and paper submission. Note that, as with any
conference, the page limits are strict! Papers over the limit will not be considered.
Poster presentation (15 points)
Poster presentation (15 points)
: We will hold a poster session in the Atrium of the Paul Allen Center. Each team will be given a
stand to present a poster summarizing the project motivation, methodology, and results. The poster session will give you a
chance to show o? the hard work you put into your project, and to learn about the projects of your peers. We will provide
poster boards that are 32x40 inches. Both one large poster or several pinned pages are OK (fonts should be easily readable
from 5 feet away).
Project Report (60 points)
Project Report (60 points)
: Your write up should be 4 pages maximum (not including references) in 
Camera-ready NIPS format
(https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles)
. You may have unlimited appendices for clarifications,
however, no reviewer is required to look at these to evaluate the work. 
You should describe the task you solved, your
approach, the algorithms, the results, and the conclusions of your analysis. Note that, as with any conference, the page limits
are strict! Papers over the limit will not be considered.

Provide the score based on overall discussion of the above topics. Do not rate each topic individually. No explanation needed.
2.2 Do courses provide a comprehensive and explicit definition of impacts of "computing systems" on AI/ML?
The definition and explanation should include concepts such as 1) scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; 3) ML programming models and abstractions; 4) programming languages for machine learning; 5) ML compilers and runtimes; 6) specialized hardware for machine learning; 7) hardware-efficient ML methods; 8) machine learning benchmarks, and tooling.
Answer by providing the list of above topics (1 to 9) discussed in the course. Make it short and direct. Limit in 100 words. Do not include topics unrelated to "computing systems" like general ML/AI algorithms.

RQ 3. Requirement Specification:
3.1 How are computational performance and capability requirements for hardware and software systems running scalable AI/ML, explicitly specified and discussed in undergraduate courses?
Topics include 1) Computational Power (CPU, GPU, TPU, Edge AI chips), Memory and Storage, Network for scalable (parallel and distributed) model training, inference; 2) Distributed Computing Frameworks such as TensorFlow's Distributed Strategy, PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and Horovod 3)  Optimization Techniques such as Efficient Algorithm, Quantization, Prunning 4) Programming Models and Abstractions such as High-Level Libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras)
Answer in Likert scale: 
Quantitatively (3): The lectures or assignments provide numerical values for computational performance and capability requirements such as latency, throughput, resource utilization etc.
Qualitatively (2): The lectures used descriptive terms.
No guidelines (1): The Lecture provide no guidelines.
Provide the score based on overall discussion of the above topics. Do not rate each topic individually. No explanation needed.
3.2 How did the discussion of “computing system” requirements rank against the discussion of general AI/ML topics?
Answer in Likert scale: 
Equally discussed with other AI/ML topics (3)
“computing system” requirements is a sub topic (2) 
“computing system” requirements were never discussed (1) 
Provide the score based on overall discussion of the above topics. Do not rate each topic individually. No explanation needed.
RQ 4. Influence and Importance:
4.1 How is the importance of various “computing system” factors of designing and maintaining scalable AI/ML emphasized in the course?
The factors are 1) scalable (parallel and distributed) model training and inference; 2) testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications; 3) ML programming models and abstractions; 4) programming languages for machine learning; 5) ML compilers and runtimes; 6) specialized hardware for machine learning; 7) hardware-efficient ML methods; 8) machine learning benchmarks, and tooling.
Answer in Likert scale:
